	<h1>Handmade Network Communication Guidelines</h1>

	<h2>Our philosophy</h2>
	<p>
		The Handmade community strives to create an environment conducive to innovation, education, and constructive discussion. To that end, we expect members of the community to respect the following set of principles to maintain civil discourse and create an inclusive environment.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Discourse</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>The community is mostly business, with a bit of fun. Discussion should primarily be about software development, and in particular about the relevant project or topic at hand.</li>
		<li>Support arguments with evidence and respectful discussion. Don't resort to ad hominem attacks or personality judgments. Don't try to get the last word; please be willing to disengage if a conversation gets or heated.</li>
		<li>Differing opinions are valuable and should be respected. Not everyone sees eye-to-eye on every matter, but we're all trying to write useful software.</li>
		<li>Be aware of differences in English comprehension and culture. What you say may be misinterpreted through no fault of your own or the listener. Please be patient and kind when misunderstandings occur.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Professional & respectful conduct</h2>
	<p>
		A Handmade community member shall not:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Sexualize or objectify others, even if they think it's a compliment.</li>
		<li>Dismiss other people's contributions, opinions, or concerns based on their personal attributes.</li>
		<li>Use pejoratives or excessively rely on foul language, especially if used to attack an individual.</li>
		<li>Disparage a person instead of criticizing their work. Handmade community members should acknowledge and respect high-quality work even if they dislike the author.</li>
		<li>Antagonize others, particularly if a disagreement has occurred.</li>
		<li>Assume a motive for uncharacteristic behavior. Everyone has a bad day.</li>
		<li>Dwell excessively on a topic or argument when the other parties involved have made it clear they are no longer interested or comfortable discussing it.</li>
		<li>Continue to ask a person to disclose information, particularly about their personal lives, when that person has declined to do so.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Integrity</h2>
	<p>
		The Handmade community values integrity, the honest pursuit of knowledge, and working hard to build effective, uncomplicated software.
	</p>
	<p>
		In particular, we strive to:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Be honest with others about the state of our work.</li>
		<li>Foster an environment where dedicated learners of any skill level may ask questions and receive detailed, useful answers.</li>
		<li>Advertise projects for what they are and what their authors reasonably hope they might become.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		It is up to the discretion of the moderators to determine when these guidelines are being met, and they are permitted to act accordingly.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you feel an action has been made against you unreasonably, please contact the <a href="/contact">Handmade Network Team</a> privately with your grievance and we will review the decision.

          This summer, we're digging out old devices and seeing what they were
          actually like to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our phones today are far more powerful than our desktop computers from decades ago. But those old computers worked just fine! The Time Machine project is a chance to revisit those old devices and see what they were actually like to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          As our hardware has improved, how has the user experience changed? Which parts have stayed the same? Which parts have gotten worse? There's only one way to find out.

            <p>
              This is the iPod Touch I got when I was 13. It was my first major
              tech purchase and an early device in the iOS lineup. When I
              purchased this I think it was running iOS 3; at this point it has
              iOS 5. I was pleased to see that the battery still holds a charge
              quite well, and it consistently runs at about 30 to 60 frames per
              second.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the video you can see several built-in apps. Media playback
              still works great, and scrubbing around in songs is instantaneous.
              App switching works well. The calculator launches instantly (as
              you would hope). I was shocked to see that the old Google Maps app
              still works - apparently they have kept their old tile-based map
              servers online. It even gave me public transit directions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall, I would say this device feels only a hair slower than my
              current iPhone.

            This summer, we're digging out old devices and seeing what they were actually like to use.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our phones today are far more powerful than our desktop computers from decades ago. And yet, those old computers worked just fine! The Time Machine project is an opportunity to boot up those old devices and see how they feel to use.
          </p>
          <p>
            As our hardware has improved, how has the user experience changed? Which parts have stayed the same? Which parts have gotten worse? There's only one way to find out.

              This is the iPod Touch I got when I was 13. It was my first major
              tech purchase and an early device in the iOS lineup. When I
              purchased this I think it was running iOS 3; at this point it has
              iOS 5. I was pleased to see that the battery still holds a charge
              quite well, and it consistently runs at about 30 to 60 frames per
              second.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the video you can see several built-in apps. Media playback
              still works great, and scrubbing around in songs is instantaneous.
              App switching works well. The calculator launches instantly (as
              you would hope). I was shocked to see that the old Google Maps app
              still works - apparently they have kept their old tile-based map
              servers online. It even gave me public transit directions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall, I would say this device feels only a hair slower than my
              current iPhone.

So you can have a light source at x 33, y 50, z 1. So all objects less than x 33 would be shadowed to the right, objects greater than would be shadowed to the left, greater than y 50 would be brighter to the front and less would be shadowed to the back... I don't know if this is making sense, but would it be possible?"

"4063": "Is there a standard / portable way in C to get a FILE* to a block / region in memory? In Linux there's fmemopen but I can't seem to find an equivalent in Windows. Internet seems to suggest MapViewOfFile but I don't think that is it, I don't want a memory mapped file, just FILE* to a memory region. Does such a thing exist or am I looking at this the wrong way?"
"4156": "Are there inherent problems with using composition for writing game engines like there are problems with OOP?"
"4178": "Why is the preprocessor able to convert a parameter to a string via the # symbol, but not the other way around, i.e. string stripping, taking the inner value of the string and pasting it? My guess is that it's because this would not make it possible for the macro to be determined at compile time since we can pass it arbitrary strings?"
"4264": "Unless I missed it, shouldn't it be CycleOverHit rather than HitOverCycle?"

"4327": "Turbo C's successor is C++ Builder from Embarcadero"
"4349": "Metaprogramming question: Let's say I want to have a generic dynamic list (resizable array) in my game library. Void-pointers and macros are two ways of approaching this; another is generating the code for the unique list types I want. Is this what you mean when you say "I write C programs that spit out C programs"? If so, can we do this generation at compile-time (like we can do in jai) or are we forced to write and run an executable that does the generation for us?"
"4409": "With respect to composition: I have a Player struct that has various other structs to represent what the player is composed of. One could be the Object struct which is added to any entity in the game that I want to behave like an object. Then I create functions that run on objects such as objectMove(Object *obj) so that anything that I want to move in the game would simply have an Object struct within it"

Can you suggest any specific usages to pursue for either program robustness, optimization, etc.?"

"7332": "Demo: Pointer declaration style"
"7480": "2) Do compiler optimisations (-O2) guarantee that the same output is generated for time-independent code? That is, does the out-of-order processing ever introduce some nasty logic / contol flow bugs that -Od wouldn't?"
"7681": "You said you didn't want to use PRETTY_FUNCTION because that wouldn't work because of duplicate GUIDs. But the only place where PRETTY_FUNCTION would have been used is in TIMED_FUNCTION, which should never be used more then once in any function anyway. So not using DEBUG_NAME in TIMED_FUNCTION would solve the problem. All the other calls to TIMED_BLOCK_ would still work with DEBUG_NAME and thus use the COUNTER to be unique.

"8270": "I guess what I was really asking was will you be dropping it?"

"6221": "Greetings Casey! Last week during the wonderful Handmade Chat you demonstrated how to dynamically create code in memory. You have mentioned in the past how you do a fair bit of meta-programming and I always envisioned that you would generate C / C++ code to files. When you tackle meta-programming, do you write out to disk first and then have it compiled? Do you do it all in memory similar to what you did last week? Combination of both?"
"6328": "Hey Casey. I was messing around with 4x4 matrix multiplication implementations and whipped out ten variations, some of which naive and others more optimal with SIMD. Out of curiosity I performance tested them all on MSVC, clang and gcc. I was very surprised by the results as the compilers seem to be doing very different things for this simple task. For example, on gcc the naive versions sometimes beat what I thought would be optimal SIMD (seems like it was able to output better intrinsics) but on clang it was the opposite. MSVC seems to have failed at unrolling a loop and all implementations were crap except for a manually unrolled SIMD version. I realize this is a rathole of a problem but is this really where we're at in terms of the philosophy of "write once and let each compiler do the best thing for the platform"? Any thoughts?"

E.g. 1 -> Sunday? Or metaprogramming is overkill for this? 1 - If you have a gigantic struct printf which you want to "automate", in the way of not having to manually enlist all its fields, metaprogramming is the way to go here, right? Probably take the definition of the struct from the (Vulkan) spec, store it in a file, for example, and match it with the struct going by the sizes and offsets of the fields?"

Now there's a latency between when we're issuing a frame until it is actually rendered (CPU / GPU latency). How are we going to keep them in sync?

"7282": "Introduce DEBUG_MEMORY_NAME to compress the debug macros"
"7663": "Q: I'm a Web developer by trade and my day-to-day code seems to abstract away more logic than you do in your engine. Could you explain why that is?"
"7712": "Q: What would you do differently if you had to work with other developers on this project?"
"7912": "Q: Yes, this is a lot better. We would have a problem when dealing with a function with 0 parameters, though (I mean, the DEBUG_MEMORY_NAME is the only parameter) because of the trailing comma"
"7954": "Q: I'm wondering what language feature would make what you have done with memory tracking easier. Would it be possible to make the entire call stack available for every function at compile time at all times so you don't have to do all this macro nonsense. I'm asking in the abstract sense, not whether C++ supports it"
"8038": "Q: If someone were looking to get into game programming today, would you recommend starting with using an engine like Unity, or would you recommend doing this lower level programming?"
"8243": "Q: (Off-topic) A question about RenderGroup, which was introduced many days ago (when we were still working on the software renderer). What is the purpose of this entity / object / API in few words nowadays? Is it essentially a command buffer for a specific FBO with for a specific glState?"
"8383": "Q: Why are games unable to saturate storage bandwidth when loading? With modern SSDs it seems like loads should never take longer than 2-3 seconds?"
"8503": "Q: You've mentioned that with the engine you are writing for 1935 you are spending a lot more time documenting your process and decisions when tackling a problem. Do you have any tips or examples of what you find useful to keep track of? And what you find is just noise? I find documenting well difficult and it's easy to write too much and, ironically, not enough"
"8596": "Q: Is there a good rule of thumb when it comes to guarding against errors in your code? Is there such a thing as too much handling? I could imagine having many if-statements to check conditions could cause a performance hit"
"8768": "Q: So does it mean that you have augmented this caller information in your metaprogramming scheme so you can always query who called you? I hope that Jon integrated these features in JAI already…"
"8801": "Q: For more specifics on where you log, do you have a file for each function? Do you have one / few giant document that you just keep adding to? Do you just add it directly to the code itself?"
"8817": "Q: RenderGroup: Thanks for answering. Sounds like an abstraction of the gl API + the notion of a renderpass?"
"8893": "Q: What are your thoughts on visual programming languages? Do you imagine good use cases for them and, if so, in what contexts do you think they work? My understanding is that it's challenging to make a good visual language and that usually the special-purpose ones work better than attempts at general-use ones"
"9047": "Q: To touch on the over-error checking, what about the case where you're making an API that is to be accessed by other developers? Right now I'm making a library for the TwitchAPI that will be constantly interfaced by users, but I feel like I'm holding their hand too much with errors instead of assuming they have any idea what they're doing, to the point where a significant amount of the library is just error checking"
"9226": "Q: Going back to a question near the beginning about "abstracting logic", I think the heart of the questions is due to a discussion about what is "clean code". Some higher level languages seem to make things "look good" but "clean code" is, at least to me, isn't very well defined. Maybe they were looking for why does this look complex vs something that's a few lines of code (but contained in a bunch of little files, in my opinion). My thoughts are due to performance, fine tuning, and knowing exactly what's going on rather than guessing. I do that a lot using python"
"9841": "Q: Have you tried Odin? Any thoughts?"
"9853": "Q: Casey, what you're saying is really good, but opposite to what devs are being told in schools…"
"10015": "Q: Java is still Intro to CS and oftentimes C / C++ is barely covered. Why do you think that is? I think it's because a lot of old "corporate" financial companies in the old guard were stuck in OOP server land. It's frustrating"

If I'm writing things online, should I always try to state things in terms of notation that beginners would understand?"
"7201": "Q: I'm missing something fundamental about spherical harmonics. I get the idea of decomposing areas into spheres, but I don't get how you could use something like that to accumulate some representation of light that you could reconstruct. Would be willing to provide an intro sometime?"
"7438": "Q: Yeah, essentially, or maybe anything with lots of jargon that's kinda essential to working with the subject seriously. I find myself on the other side a lot when I'm doing, like, FPGA stuff and I have no idea what people are talking about, but once I learn all of the jargon it becomes second nature to think about things in those terms. If that makes sense"
"8187": "Q: Thanks. I guess I put too much emphasis on accumulation and reconstruction. I can reason about what you just said about orthogonality and addition. My misunderstanding is more fundamental. I understand how you can use ray tracing to get light intensities and colors at probe points, which can be passed to your fragment shader, but I don't get how you can get some spherical representation of light at probe points, and what the heck your fragment shader would do with it"

"7128": "Q: Hey master Casey. Is there a way to suggest / home [hint] the processor that a branch is likely / not likely taken? Goal is to help with branch prediction"
"7265": "Q: I was watching an early stream where you said something along the lines of "I've never worked on a commercial compiler". So, have you ever worked on a non-commercial compiler or something of the sort?"
"7355": "Q: Not relevant to today's episode but what C / C++ books do you recommend for a beginner?"
"7373": "Q: What's your guess on how much faster GPU trilinear sampling is compared to CPU side? Also, could you not bounce the light on GPU side and be faster even on non RTX cards? What are the reasons against doing that? Is it just to keep complexity at Handmade Hero scope?"
"7524": "Q: It seems unlikely that Intel / AMD would change the default behavior of branch prediction, considering things like PGO and gcc __builtin_expect assume that behavior"
"7560": "Q: Have you considered the fact that if you just said Handmade Hero had an AI based lighting solution you could say it was now done?"
"7573": "Q: I understand you're doing a unity build in Handmade Hero. What is the meaning of internal in this scenario?"
"7606": "Q: Hi! I got contacted by two companies to work as a C programmer. One job on numerical computing and data visualization, and the other one on cryptography. They also wrote to me that they have a hard time in finding people who are interested in the low level-ish programming. Do you think it is because the majority of people use python, java script or high level languages? I guess there is always a job if someone can do C and a bit assembly"
"7660": "Q: When running Visual Studio with my executable as an argument I can't find the project properties window in which you would set #defines. Do you know why that happens?"
"7688": "Q: Just catching up on the show again. What do we have left, other than lighting and actual gameplay?"
"7812": "Q: Which features of C++ do you think are conducive to performance oriented programming and which do you think are detrimental and should be avoided? I noticed that you use default arguments sometimes, for example"
"7862": "Q: When adding the normals together, doesn't immediately normalizing after each add make the result dependent on the order of the vectors? I guess NOZ(NOZ(NOZ(a) + b) + c) != NOZ(NOZ(NOZ(c) + b) + a) is what I am saying. (I don't remember the exact routine where you did this.)"

I've heard you talk about the technical reasons, but I still don't understand why companies would give up on having better software quality than their competitors. Is it because education is bad? Is it because non-performance oriented software is being normalized to the point people don't care about it? Is it because hardware has been compensating for the lack of software performance?"

(Let's call this entry_structure.) In order to add an item to the end of the list you need to create a new entry_structure, set the prev pointer to the previous last entry, and UPDATE THE LAST entry_structure in order to have next point to the new last item. Is there any other structure that represents a doubly linked list without this prerequisite?"

"8416": "Q: handmade_hero Hello Casey, this question may be off-topic but it's really important for me. I know you were doing some UI development. I saw your video on immediate mode UI. I have the only job opportunity to develop UI for mobile app but I've never done that and I need this job. So can you please give me some advice on where to find information, maybe some guides on UI development and were you using some library or did you write everything from scratch? It would be very helpful for me"

It's true that I should always pay extra attention where I think I need to, but I don't know what's coming within the 600 episodes and whether spending extra time on things that I thought needed the extra time will be worth it or not as opposed to getting a conceptual idea on the subject and move on"

I learn a lot from the in-depth videos on how a computer actually works on a fundamental level, like the C tutorial and the blackboard videos (and I have been programming for 10 years). I am really excited about Star Code Galaxy. Do you have any information about when it will launch and what kind of material it will it cover?"

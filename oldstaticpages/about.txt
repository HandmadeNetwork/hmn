    We're a small group of programmers and idealists who are trying to make
programming better for everyone. And we think the best way to do that is by
collecting the best, down-to-earth programming projects in one place and
building a community of the most talented programmers and most eager learners we
can find.

Abner Coimbre started Handmade Network when rallying the Handmade Hero community around a common goal. He leads the policies, initiatives, and public facing of the network. Abner became NASA's Kennedy Intern of the Year in 2015 and was named to Kennedy’s 2016 Top 10 Innovators. In 2017 Abner  moved to Seattle, WA to work for Jonathan Blow's studio Thekla Inc.

Jeroen is just this guy, you know. He's a veteran programmer who at one time found himself chin deep in webdev and
decided the best thing for his sanity was to retire from it. Then Abner proposed what would become Handmade Network and
he decided to dust off his keyboard and join the fray, only to find the keyboard wasn't particularly dusty yet. Some
keys were getting stuck or unresponsive, sure, but a replacement keyboard soon fixed that. When not wrangling RSI, he
develops the backend software that makes the website tick.  <br/><br/> Apart from this he has a keen interest in low-level
programming, optimisation, compiler writing and games development, among other subjects. When the site software is
sufficiently mature, he plans to do an educational series on the Handmade Network, passing on some of the 30 years of
collected knowledge he's gathered.

    <h2 target="_blank" class="realname">Matt Mascarenhas</h2>
        <p class="bio">
Matt is a lifelong computer user, music player and book reader. In contrast to everyone else on the Handmade Network
team, his education only touched on computer programming, having culminated with a degree in English language and
literature. Or, rather, it would have culminated there had Casey not begun his educational programming project Handmade
Hero.
<br/><br/>
Within the Handmade Network, Matt has become the person to ask if you want to know if / when Casey covered a particular
topic on Handmade Hero – at least until the annotation system receives its long-expected overhaul, at which point he'll
become partially redundant – and will be the first port of call should you have any issues with the Handmade Network
website.
<br/><br/>
While not annotating or grepping the annotations for answers to people's questions, Matt practises programming in C with
a view to developing a bunch of software – to play, to run your console-based applications, for doing linguistic
research and for staging theatrical productions – writes audio and story for games, and evangelises his Arch Linux
system, taking full credit for Abner's discovery of the beautiful distribution.

Andrew is co-developer of Handmade Network and a student of computer engineering at the University of Washington. When he's not coding away at his project of the month, he can be found doing pointless math and cracking bad jokes on niche experimental decentralized social networks.

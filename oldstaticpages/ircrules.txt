<p>

The Handmade Network IRC and all channels hosted on it follow the same <a href="/guidelines">basic set of rules</a> as
the rest of the site. You are still using Handmade Network-provided utilities and interacting with the same community,
even if you are not doing so through a web browser pointed at the site. It is up to the channel and server operators to
decide how to best maintain a civil and constructive chat environment, and they will act as they see fit to maintain it.

    Additional notes:
    <ul>
        <li>Spamming, repetitive arguments that clog up the chat, or refusal to cooperate with a reasonable request from
        a moderator may result in a ban from the chat at the moderator's sole discretion.</li>
        <li>Excessive join/part messages annoy some IRC users. If your internet is intermittent and you aren't actively
        talking in chat, consider closing your client until connection issues are resolved, or use a repeater. Full logs 
        on public channels will be made available in the near future.</li>
        <li>Abusive behavior will not be tolerated. If it is determined that a user or group of users are participating
        in targeted abuse (such as serial trolling/flaming and/or making serious threats), they will be banned
        immediately.</li>
    </ul>

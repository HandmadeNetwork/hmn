    The Handmade community strives to create an environment conducive to
    innovation, education, and constructive discussion. To that end, we expect
    members of the site to respect a basic set of principles to maintain civil
    discourse and create an inclusive environment. It is up to the discretion
    of the moderators to determine when these guidelines are being met, and
    they are permitted to act accordingly. If you feel an action has been made
    against you unreasonably, please <a href="/contact">contact</a> an admin
    privately with your grievance and we will review the decision.

    Some loose principles to follow while on handmade.network:
    <ul>
        <li>We're mostly business, with a bit of fun. Discussion should primarily be about software development, and in
        particular about the relevant project or topic given in the title where you are discussing. Overt advertising
        (beyond reasonably relevant mention or reference) in other projects will not be tolerated.</p>
        <li>Support arguments with evidence and rational discussion. Don't resort to ad hominem attacks or personality
        judgements.</li>
        <li>Differing opinions are valuable and should be respected. Not everyone sees eye-to-eye on every
        matter, but we're all trying to write useful software. Try to keep an open mind.</li>
        <li>Language has meaning, and can be used in destructive ways. Be aware that what you say may not seem
        injurious to you, but might make someone else's experience on the site tangibly worse. If you are asked to
        reconsider your conduct, please exercise some introspection. We want everyone to feel welcome here.</p>
    </ul>
